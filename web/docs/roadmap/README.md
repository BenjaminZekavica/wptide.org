# Roadmap

Feel free to view our backlog on [GitHub](https://github.com/wptide/wptide.org/projects). The following items are not an exhaustive list but are currently planned as part of the upcoming Tide roadmap. This page is evolving and expect to see more changes soon.

## Tide version 1.0.0

Agile Board: ( [v1.0.0](https://github.com/wptide/wptide.org/projects) )

* Goal: Provide documentation and working examples of Tide to help developers and contributors better utilize and improve Tide.
* Goal: Begin integration on .ORG (via PHP Compatibility results) and first step in actually improving the quality of code on 38% of the web.
* Goal: Begin integration with the [PHP Compatibility Checker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/) by WP Engine, which would make Tide a data provider instead of executing a PHPCS report directly on the Web Server.
