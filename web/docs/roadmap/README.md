# Roadmap

Feel free to view our backlog on [GitHub][project]. The 
following items are not an exhaustive list but are currently planned as part of the upcoming 
Tide roadmap. This page is evolving and expect to see more changes soon.

## Tide version 1.0.0

Agile Board: ( [v1.0.0][project] )

* Goal: Provide documentation and working examples of Tide to help developers and contributors 
  better utilize and improve Tide.
* Goal: Begin integration on .ORG (via PHP Compatibility results) as a first step in actually 
  improving the quality of code on 43% of the web.
* Goal: Begin integration with the [PHP Compatibility Checker][compat] by WP Engine, which 
  would make Tide a data provider instead of executing a PHPCS report directly on the Web 
  Server.
