# Introduction

## Vision

> A rising tide lifts all boats. -- United States President, John F. Kennedy (borrowed from 
> the New England Council)

Inspired by the proverb _"A rising tide lifts all boats"_, we want to lift the quality of 
code across the WordPress ecosystem. **Tide’s vision is to run automated quality testing for 
all WordPress plugins and themes and make those test results visible for the authors and end 
users of those plugins and themes.** This will help improve the quality of code throughout 
the WordPress ecosystem and help WordPress site owners make better choices about plugins and 
themes.

## Current status

The Tide project is an [official component of the WordPress project][tide] and in the early 
stages of development. Today, Tide scans all WordPress plugins and themes and provides scan 
results as JSON through the Tide API.

The next step is to use the JSON output in the WordPress plugin and theme repository to show 
PHP compatibility information. This will help drive the adoption of the newest PHP versions 
as both plugin/theme authors and WordPress site owners installing those plugins and themes 
will be more aware of the PHP compatibility of each plugin/theme.

Progress can be followed in the WordPress Meta issue tracker (ticket [#4309][meta-ticket]).

## Technical overview

Tide services are responsible for the following:

* The [wptide.org](../README.md) website (built with [VuePress][vuepress]) includes this 
  documentation and serves the [Tide API](services/README.md#api-server) JSON endpoints. Visit the 
  [Specification](specification/README.md) page to see examples of the API response.
* The [Lighthouse Server](services/README.md#lighthouse-server) reads messages from a queue 
  and runs Google Lighthouse reports against themes only, then writes the results back to the 
  Tide API.
* The [PHPCS Server](services/README.md#phpcs-server) reads messages from a queue and runs 
  reports against both plugins and themes, then writes the results back to the Tide API.
* The [Sync Server](services/README.md#sync-server) makes scheduled requests to the 
  WordPress.org Themes and Plugins API's to determine which projects have changed since the 
  last request, then adds them to a Pub/Sub queue associated by report type which is then 
  processed by the relevant [Report Server](services/README.md#report-servers).

In addition, we are working on the meta repository of WordPress.org to handle fetching the 
reports generated by Tide and showing summaries of them in the WordPress.org plugin and theme 
directories.

### WordPress.org components

* [Tide syncer][tide-syncer] initiates an audit and fetches the reports from the Tide API.
* [Plugin widget][plugin-widget] is where the Tide API data will be publicly visible.

### Architecture diagram

The following diagram notes which Google Cloud Platform (GCP) components are used to 
represent the various Tide services, and how the themes and plugins API on WordPress.org 
connects to the Sync Server. The basic flow is that a User or an API Client will make a 
request to the Tide REST API, which sends back a response. The request could create messages
in the queue where one or more services process them by running automated scripts and writing
the results back to the Tide API. Additionally, the Sync Server will poll the WordPress.org 
API's for new themes and plugins to add to the message queue.

@todo

## Working with Tide

Currently, you can:

* Request plugins & themes using the [Specification](specification/README.md) page which 
  allows you to make requests to the various Tide API endpoints using a built-in UI generated
  from our OpenAPI v3 Specification.
* [Install](installation/) Tide to help test and develop locally.
* Deploy Tide to [Google Cloud](google-cloud/) and run your own variation of Tide in the 
  cloud.

In the future, we hope to provide authors with the ability to use Tide as a service to test 
their plugins or themes during development.

## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to Tide. You can help us champion the adoption of the 
quality testing results in the WordPress project. You can also help by contributing code or 
documentation to Tide itself.

Please read our [Contributing](contributing/README.md) guide for details on the process of 
creating a ticket or submitting a pull request to Tide, and our 
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct/README.md).
