## API Server

The [API Specification v1](https://staging.wptide.org/api/spec/v1/) definition and usage reference for the wptide.org JSON API server provides a user interface to lean about the API endpoints and make requests. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the API schema, parameters, and responses.

The API is the public endpoint of the Tide service, and can be used to fetch audits and reports for any version of any WordPress plugin or theme.
