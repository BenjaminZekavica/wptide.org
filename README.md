Tide is an automated tool to provide insight into WordPress code and highlight areas to improve the quality of plugins and themes.

We believe the web can be better. With Tide, the code which underpins every website can be more standardized, faster, and more secure. Tide is focused on WordPress because no other platform has as large an impact on the state of the web. Tide raises the quality of code one plugin or theme at a time, by elevating the importance of code quality in the developer consciousness. Because a rising Tide lifts all boats.
